# Practical-Machine-Learning_Course-Project
I was not able to generate the html file in knitr from my Rmd file. About 61% of the file would generate but then when the random forest model began to run, R would hang up and eventaully close itself. I serached for ideas as to why this might be so and the possible fixes but found nothing. 

Therefore I generated a docx file which I hope you will be able to read and grade easily. I apologize in advance if this causes you extra work.

Contains the word report and the Rmd file
